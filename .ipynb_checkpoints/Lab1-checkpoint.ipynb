You will learn some coding skills, how to import and manipulate a table, and how to plot some cool graphs to turn numbers into visualizations. Don't worry about memorizing everything contained in this notebook -- we provide a \"cheat sheet\" you can refer to toward the end! These are skills we will build on next lecture and lab to analyze relationships between race, environmental factors and health outcomes -- have this big picture in mind as you go through the lab today.

    "- To import data from a .csv/.txt file, we write `Table.read_table(\"file_name\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create our own table, we write `Table( ).with_columns(\"Column Name\", array_name, . . .)` . \n",
    "\n",
    "- To count number of rows, we use `table_name.num_rows`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To count number of columns, we use `table_name.num_columns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a new table with only the columns indicated in the parameters, we use `table_name.select(\"COLUMN NAME\", ...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a new table without the columns indicated in the parameters, we use `table_name.drop(\"COLUMN NAME\", ...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a table with only certain values, we can use `table_name.where(column_name, predicate)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a new table with indicated rows from the original table, we use `table_name.take([index 1, index 2, . . . ])`. Remember in Python indices start at 0!\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a scatter plot, we use `table.scatter(column for x axis, column for y axis)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a line plot, we use `table.plot(x column, y column)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make a bar graphs, we can use either `table.bar(x column, y column)` or `table.barh(x column, y column)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To make a histogram, we use `table.hist(x axis, bins(optional), unit(optional))`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To merge tables, we use either `append` or `append_column`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To merge two tables with a common column name we use the `join` method.\n",
