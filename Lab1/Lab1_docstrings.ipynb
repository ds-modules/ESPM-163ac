You will learn some coding skills, how to import and manipulate a table, and how to plot some cool graphs to turn numbers into visualizations. Don't worry about memorizing everything contained in this notebook -- we provide a \"cheat sheet\" you can refer to toward the end! These are skills we will build on next lecture and lab to analyze relationships between race, environmental factors and health outcomes -- have this big picture in mind as you go through the lab today.

The blue <span style=\"color:blue\">add_two</span> is the name of the function which you can use later to repeat the operation, and the `n` in parentheses is the parameter/input.
